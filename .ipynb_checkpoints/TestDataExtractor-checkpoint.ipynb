      "               's24': u'Each of the cables carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second , so the tapped cables had the capacity , in theory , to deliver more than 21 petabytes a day \\u2013 equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours .
